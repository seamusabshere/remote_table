* Enhancements

  * delimited parser accepts an optional :replace_quotes param that swaps double quotes for single quotes.

3.0.0 / 2013-11-26

* Breaking changes

  * Include columns with blank headers as "untitled_N"
  * skip blank lines at the top of CSV files when looking for headers [rc2]
  * require rubyzip2 for Roo compatibility with Ruby 1.9 [rc2]
  * :parser object must respond to #call(row), not #parse(row) [rc1]
  * Whitespace now automatically "normalized" (/\s+/ -> ' ', stripped) for CSV [rc1]
  * Strip whitespace from headers unless you provide them as an array [beta]
  * Not passing anything options on to CSV... use :delimiter instead of :col_sep [beta]
  * Just use :encoding to specify a file's internal/initial/original encoding. No more :internal_encoding, this was jargony. [alpha]
  * No more shapefile support - hard to imagine a shapefile as a table [alpha]
  * No more :transform, legacy or not [alpha]
  * For :errata, now you pass an object that responds to #rejects?(row) and #correct!(row) [alpha]
  * No more :errata_settings [alpha]

* Enhancements

  * eagerly load format-specific methods (instead of waiting for #each to be called) [rc2]
  * use new Roo class names (Roo::OpenOffice instead of Roo::Openoffice) [rc2]
  * Support relative paths with spaces [beta]
  * :parser option takes an object that responds to #parse(row) and returns an array of one or more rows. [alpha]
  * RemoteTable.transpose(url, key_key, value_key) helper [alpha]

* Bug fixes

  * pass CSV options to header parser - before, options like delimiter weren't passed so it couldn't read TSVs [rc2]

  * Don't try to set default_sheet if user doesn't specify a sheet name
